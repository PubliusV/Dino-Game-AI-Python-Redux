# Google-Chrome-Dino-Game-AI For Filthy Python Casuals

This fork is all about translating CodeBullet's Dino Game and AI into Python where possible as a learning exercise. In order to better understand the logic, I also heavily referenced @wayou and his JS extraction of the [source code from Chromium](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner).

This might be stupid. It might be a massive headache, but why else do we code if not to torture ourselves for no reason?
